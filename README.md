# Kamet Portfolio

This is a one-page portfolio to showcase the work we the members of Portfolio-team-2 of Side Hustle Bootcamp Cohort 5.0 did.
We are frontend developers and all projects were built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript only. 


The portfolio consists of different sections: 
* About Us 
* Skills
* Projects and
* Contact Us among others
